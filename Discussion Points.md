# Discussion Points

## Terrain
* Tile map as terrain
* Destructable terrain - i.e. remove a tile out of the tilemap

## Mechanics
* Player Movement - make more smash bros like?
* Should there be more skills - can you hit another player without having to use the terrain
* Should removing a block from the terrain be an 'ultimate' move - takes a long time and has a "charge-time" to complete

## Roles
* Assign movement, skills, terrain, animation/sprites to different people?
* Who is the product Owner?
* Who is the product Manager?

### Product Owner
The Product Owner is the one who verifies what features should or should not make it into the game.
Everyone else has a say, but it is ultimately decided by the Product Owner.

The Product Owner cannot be the Product Manager.

### Product Manager
The Product Manager is the one who will keep the group on track, and acheiving the goals.
THe Product Manager cannot be the Product Owner.
