## Move List Idea 1

- A button: Attack
  - With no block in hand, this is a punch that knocks away blocks in front of you. It can be angled up or down.
    - Can also hit players, though it’s not as effective
    - Blocks hit in this way fly in a straight line
    - This can be used on blocks flying towards you
  - When a block is held, this throws the block in one of eight directions
  - Throwing it downwards just places the block in front of you
  - Blocks thrown this way are affected by gravity
  - Throwing a block while in mid-air changes your momentum
- B button: Special
  - Varies based on the character
  - Some moves require meter, or have EX versions
- Y button: Jump
  - Characters have two jumps
  - Can wall jump once before touching the ground
- X button: Inventory
  - Press X while holding in a direction to pick up the block in that direction
    - Can be used on blocks in the air, though it’s hard to time
  - Hold X while holding up to store/retrieve a block from the inventory (a bit slow to do)
  - Hold X while pressing left and right to cycle through the inventory
- ABXY buttons: Super
  - Varies based on the character
  - Consumes the whole meter/inventory
  - Slight variations based on what blocks are in the inventory
