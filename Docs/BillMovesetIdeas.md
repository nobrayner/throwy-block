# Bill Moveset Ideas

- Block Factory:
  - Place down a block that creates another block above it when there is empty space.
  - Costs two matching blocks in the inventory. This block matches the one the factory creates

- Rocket Charge:
  - Charges sideways
  - Long start-up time
  - Can collide with three things before stopping
  - Costs one block in the inventory
- Rocket Jump:
  - Hold to charge up
  - Release to rocket upwards
  - Blows away blocks around your start position
  - Puts you into freefall
  - Costs one block in the inventory
- Energy Ball:
  - Creates a sphere of energy that rolls along the ground
  - Detonates on contact, causing light knockback
  - Somewhat slow to use
  - Free

- Supermassive:
  - Spends 5 blocks from the inventory
  - Forms a black hole that begins to draw in other blocks/enemies
  - The more objects sucked in, the bigger the area of effect
  - After a while, the black hole explodes, dealing knockback relative to its size
